      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always aspired to the sterile Disney World ideal.

      <title>Evaluating Technology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very curious about the purpose of technology. Specifically my intuitions, based of course on my value driven biases, lead me to believe that all technology should or at least could be evaluated based on its ability to enhance some aspect of humanity and the trade-offs. I think this is supported by the fact that technology, by definition, is always a product of human innovation. This notion however may not hold true with the advent of Artificial Intelligence.
Some thoughts I want to explore in this regard:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell anymore what the trends are in pop-sci-culture with the way we are fed content via the machines. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a whole lot of &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; pushed into my online notice in recent weeks. Much of this content is related to the proposition of purposelessness that Robert Sapolsky has made with his book Determined. I did listen to this Audible book a couple months back, and presumably the machines are well aware of that, and as such are willing this related content in my direction. One of these pieces, the greatest grabber of my interest but turned out to be disappointingly  unrevealing, was a podcasted debate between Robert Sapolsky and Daniel Dennett. Daniel Dennett is the most familiar to me adherent of compatibilism, that  is the contention that free will is not incompatible with a determinism.  Dennett&amp;rsquo;s perspective, (my possibly inaccurate interpretation) is that we do in fact have free will, if we constrain the boundaries of an individual&amp;rsquo;s decision making  to only the psychological variables relevant to the context of the situation that demands a conscious decision. At least that&amp;rsquo;s the best argument I can make based on my understanding of his. And I do want to find a good argument for the compatibility of free will in a deterministic framework of human behavior. A core premise, or assumption, of this point of view is  that conscious decisions directly influence behavior. And this is a hard case to make, particularly since we can&amp;rsquo;t find a good scientific, much less conversational baseline to start to flesh out what consciousness is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
