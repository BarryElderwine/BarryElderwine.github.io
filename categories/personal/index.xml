      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the video &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXymLAqqIs&#34;&gt;Why I Converted to Christianity - Ayaan Hirsi Ali&lt;/a&gt; to be oddly reassuring. Alex O&amp;rsquo;Conner does a very nice job of revealing the both the reason and emotion behind his Ayaan&amp;rsquo;s, views, behavior and the values that underly them. This approach to discussion is nearly all but lost in everyday discourse nowadays.  I&amp;rsquo;ve suggested this video to some friends and,  in explaining to them why I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth the time and attention, they each wanted to argue against the reasoning of Ayaan solely based on my representation of her perspectives. This of course underscores the very issue I&amp;rsquo;m trying to raise. It appears the starting point of any discussion now is almost a strike first posture, coming from either side, feeling the need change the mind of the other with &amp;ldquo;common sense&amp;rdquo; reasoning. So why did I find this discussion between Alex and Ayaan so reassuring in spite of the fact that Ayaan seems to me to be so clearly misguided? I do believe that her perspectives are emotionally honest. This somewhat quells my anxiety that comes from my own lack of empathy for those who, to me, feel like they are intentionally being discompassionate and intellectually dishonest. It seems clear that Ayaan is at her core is a compassionate person. So a reasonable explanation for her support for, what I believe are, irrational and unkind perspectives is that her history and experience have put her in a place to receive bad information and develop bias blinded viewpoints with this information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;reasoning-a-site-four-sore-eyes&#34;&gt;Reasoning &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;A Site Four Sore Eyes&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is  place where I can publish my ideas for the audience of me. I have an ever growing number of thixotropic reasons for setting up this platform.  Probably the greatest overarching argument is to give me a place where I can air out my most persistent ruminations. This, in my fuzzy uncheckable logic, might - just might - provide some time and virtual space between my, in-this-moment thoughts, and my many-later-moments reconsiderations, allowing me to take them in with fresher, or simply differently focused eyes. In support of that objective I hope this platform will also allow me to write and publish more freely, with the only critic I might choose to answer to being that one (or small set) that resides in my mind, wherever that lives inside of me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
